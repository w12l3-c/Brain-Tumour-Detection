# Brain-Tumour-Detection

This model will take in Brain MRI image to determine the whether it has a tumour by pattern recognizing the abnormalities in it.

It is a transfer learning model using EfficientNet as base model because the basic structure of CNN(Convolution, Pooling, Batch Normalization) is resource intensive but produce a bad accuracy(i don't have a gpu). The Transfer Learning Approach result in a 94% Accuracy in train, test and validation dataset.

This is a model build base on the datatset in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset)
